/*
	Some code here is a bit sloppy and might
	fail on a 16-bit machine. I declare several
	variables as unsigned then assign items of
	type time_t or even long into them.

	To extract bits from the timer, we use
	timer modulo 5, 7, 31 or 255

	This better than just selecting some
	of the low bits with a mask or with
	a modulo operation using a power of
	two. It lets all input bits affect
	the output.

	We do not need larger moduli because
	we do not expect a timer sample to
	have more than a few bits of
	entropy.

	On the other hand, if there are
	sometimes two bits of entropy,
	then mod 2 or mod 3 would lose
	some, and mod 4 uses only low
	bits so it would lose any that
	are in high bits. mod 5 or mod 7
	are then better

	mod 31 or mod 255 are suitable if
	more entropy is expected
