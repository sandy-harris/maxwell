/*
	Quasi-Hadamard transform
	My own invention

	Goal is to mix a 32-bit object
	so that each output bit depends
	on every input bit

	Underlying primitive is IDEA
	multiplication which mixes
	a pair of 16-bit objects

	This is analogous to the
	pseudo-Hadamard transform
	(PHT) originally from the
	SAFER cipher, later in
	Twofish and others

	Conceptually, a two-way PHT
	on a,b is:

	x = a + b
	y = a + 2b
	a = x
	b = y

	This is reversible; it loses
	no information. Each output
	word depends on both inputs.

	A PHT can be implemented as

	a += b
	b += a

	which is faster and avoids
	using intermediate variables

	QHT is the same thing using
	IDEA multiplication instead
	of addition, calculating a*b
	and a*b^2 instead of a+b and
	a+2b

	IDEA multiplication operates
	on 16-bit chunks and makes
	every output bit depend on
	all input bits. Therefore
	QHT is close to an ideal
	mixer for 32-bit words.
